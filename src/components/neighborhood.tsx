/**
 * `galleryColumns` is a 2D array representing the structure of a gallery grid.
 * Each inner array represents a column of the gallery.
 * Each object within these columns represents a single image on display.
 *
 * Each image object has two properties:
 * 1. `source`: (string) relative path or URL to the image file
 * 2. `orientation`: (string) can be either 'landscape' or 'portrait'. This
 * property represents the orientation of the image and is crucial for
 * maintaining the overall layout of the gallery grid. It should not be changed
 * after it has been set.
 *
 * An image's `orientation` not only impacts the display of the individual
 * image, but it is vital for the layout of the gallery grid.
 * The system uses this value to calculate and allocate the necessary space for
 * each image, hence it should not be changed to maintain the shape of the
 * gallery.
 *
 * Images used for each object should comply with the orientation to maintain
 * consistency and response throughout the gallery. If the orientation is equal
 * to 'landscape', the image `width` should be 1920 and the `height` 1280. If
 * the orientation is 'portrait', the `width` should be 1280 and the `height` 1920.
 *
 * Remember, in-case the `source` or `orientation` for an image needs to be
 * changed, it's crucial to ensure that the new image aligns with the stated
 * orientation and dimensions for accurate rendering of the gallery.
